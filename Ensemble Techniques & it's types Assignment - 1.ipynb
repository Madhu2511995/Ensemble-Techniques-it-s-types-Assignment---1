    "#### Ensemble techniques:\n",
    "Ensemble techniques in machine learning are a set of methods that combine the predictions from multiple individual machine learning models to make more accurate and robust predictions. The fundamental idea behind ensemble techniques is that by aggregating the results of multiple models, you can often achieve better performance than any single model on its own.\n",

    "Ensemble methods are particularly useful when individual models might have varying strengths and weaknesses or when there is uncertainty in selecting the best model for a particular problem. They are widely used in both classification and regression tasks."

    "\n",
    "#### 2.Reduced Overfitting: \n",
    "Ensembles can help reduce overfitting, a common problem in machine learning where a model performs well on the training data but poorly on unseen data. When combining the predictions from multiple models, the noise and errors in individual models tend to cancel out, leading to more generalized and less overfit models."

This iterative process focuses on the challenging or hard-to-predict examples and often leads to improved predictive performance."

    "\n",
    "The success of an ensemble often depends on the diversity of the base models.

It's a powerful tool for assessing the variability of a statistic and for making inferences when you have limited data. The bootstrap method involves the following steps:\n",

This means that a data point can be selected multiple times in a given bootstrap sample, and some data points may not be selected at all. Each bootstrap sample should have the same size as the original dataset.\n",
